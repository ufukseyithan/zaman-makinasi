# Zaman Makinas覺
Zaman Makinas覺 (Time Machine in English) is a countdown platform that covers movies, video games, exam dates, holidays, etc. I have coded Zaman Makinas覺 from scratch with pure PHP (no framework or library used), jQuery, HTML & CSS. The focus is to serve a better esthetic across other countdown platforms which I found to be really bad back in the day. The primary benefit of Zaman Makinas覺 is to save time by not reading lengthy local news just to know when something's going to happen (you find them a lot in Turkey). It also lets you like the countdown cards (as in bookmarking them) to save them for future purposes. 

Zaman Makinasi is one of my first web development projects and the first website I had published for a year. It taught me quite a bit.
